# Active State And Rules

Status: **authoritative and current.** Last verified by live audit 2026-08-18.

This file outranks every other document in this repository. Read it before
`docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md`, before `START_HERE.md`, and before any
`phase*` file.

## Document Precedence

Contradictions between documents are resolved in this order. A lower-ranked
file never overrides a higher-ranked one.

```text
1. docs/ACTIVE_STATE_AND_RULES.md     This file. Current truth and rules.
2. docs/plan_phase1_maturation_and_phase2_audio.md
                                      Current work: Phase 1 maturation, then

                                      separate agent.
4. docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md    Execution contract, gates, boundaries.

5. MIGRATION_STATUS.md / START_HERE.md  Navigation aids.
6. docs/phase*                        Immutable historical records.
                                      Never cite as current state.
```

Every `docs/phase*` file is a frozen record of one past attempt. Several of them
state conclusions that were true only on their own date. Do not read a `phase*`
file to learn what is true now.

## Project Posture Changed

The library was built as a feasibility spike: prove that one narrow vertical
slice (DashScope + image) could carry a stable public contract. That question
is answered. The contract, quality-gate, and error layers work.

**The posture is now a maintained product**, not a probe. This changes three
things:

- Defects in shipped surface outrank new capability. A known false-success path
  is not acceptable because "the phase is complete".
- Structure is justified by an observed failure, not by an anticipated one.
  Anything already built that lacks a consumer is frozen, not extended.
- Documentation is a maintained artifact with a single current-state file, not
  an append-only research log.

Phase 1 is consequently reopened for maturation. "Phase 1 is GO" means the image
path was proven once under trial constraints; it does not mean the image path is
finished. Trial-shaped constraints — a hardcoded model list, all-or-nothing
resume, one attempt per request — are now defects of maturity and are being
removed. See `docs/plan_phase1_maturation_and_phase2_audio.md`.

## Known Debt In This Repository

Future agents must assume the following and verify before trusting any claim:

- **Documentation lags code.** Several files still describe capabilities as
  absent that shipped, and one normative section still reports a superseded
  NO-GO. Prefer reading code and tests over prose.
- **Structure runs ahead of demand.** `contracts/` and `worker/` are 1,817
  lines (23% of the library) serving a subprocess protocol with no consumer.
  They are correct and tested; they are also not yet load-bearing.
- **Recognition logic is small.** `processors/`, `profiles/`, and `imaging/`
  total 1,059 lines. Most of the library is contract and validation. That ratio
  is acceptable for a library, but it means new capability is cheap and new
  ceremony is expensive. Bias toward capability.

## Verified State, 2026-08-18

Confirmed by execution, not by reading prose. Method noted so it can be redone.

| Property | Result | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Test suite | 987 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed (87 s) | `python -m pytest -q` |
| Import weight | 78 ms, 114 modules | timed `import ocrllm` |
| Heavy-module isolation | `PIL`, `openai`, `httpx`, `onnxruntime` all absent after plain import | `sys.modules` probe |
| Phase 1 evidence integrity | 107,246 bytes, SHA-256 `6f0454d6…a96b`, exact match to the recorded claim | `Get-FileHash` |
| Pinned model exists | `qwen3.7-plus-2026-05-26` served by the account | live `GET /models` |
| Snapshot isolation | Provider reads original bytes while a concurrent thread overwrites the source | threaded race probe |
| Corrupt-input rejection | zero-byte, truncated, and extension/content mismatch all raise `InvalidSource` before dispatch | live probe |
| Secret redaction | `api_key` absent from `repr`, error message, and error details | live probe |
| Live error mapping | 401, 403 `AllocationQuota.FreeTierOnly`, 404, timeout all mapped to correct type and disposition | live paid probe |

These are load-bearing and must not regress. The error taxonomy and the
snapshot isolation are the two strongest parts of this codebase; build on them.

## Defect Register

Open defects in shipped surface. Severity is impact on a real user, not effort.
Do not close an entry without a test that fails before the fix.

All seven entries were addressed on 2026-08-18. Regression coverage for D1-D4
lives in `tests/test_defect_register_regressions.py`; verify with:

```powershell
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

### D1 — Provider refusal text is accepted as success. **High. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

`providers/validate_provider_markdown.py` only asked whether the response
contained a visible character. A model that replied `无法识别图片内容，请重新上传`
or `I'm sorry, I can't help with identifying content in this image` was returned
to the caller as a successful recognition.

Fix: `providers/looks_like_refusal.py` ports the legacy
`core/output_quality.py::looks_like_refusal` remedy and is applied inside
`validate_provider_markdown`. A refusal now raises `ProviderError` with code
`PROVIDER_RESPONSE_INVALID` and `details["reason"] == "refusal"`; empty output
carries `details["reason"] == "empty"`. Detection is capped at 300 visible
characters so a long transcription that merely contains a refusal phrase is
still accepted.

Not addressed by this fix: the Phase 1 v17 GO ran through the old validator, so
that gate could not distinguish a refusal from a transcription. The GO is not
re-established by this change.

### D2 — `Config.timeout_seconds` is not enforced for injected providers. **High. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

`timeout_seconds` was only threaded into the DashScope OpenAI client, so an
injected provider that blocked hung the caller permanently.

Fix: `providers/bounded_provider_call.py` runs each injected-provider call on a
pre-warmed daemon worker thread and joins it with `Config.timeout_seconds`,
raising `ProviderError(code="PROVIDER_TIMEOUT", retryable=True)` when the bound
elapses. The worker is started and parked *before* the request-start gate is
awaited, so thread startup does not disturb the measured provider cadence, and
it never dispatches when the gate raises instead of releasing. Built-in
DashScope calls keep their transport timeout and are not wrapped.

Known limit: a wedged provider thread cannot be killed. It is abandoned as a
daemon thread rather than allowed to block interpreter shutdown.

### D3 — `recognize_batch` discards completed paid work on any failure. **High. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

Fix: execution stays fail-fast, but the raised `OCRLLMError` now carries
`partial_results`, an ordered tuple with every completed `RecognitionResult` and
`None` for items that did not finish, plus `details["batch_completed_count"]`
and `details["batch_dispatched_count"]`. The parallel path drains futures that
were already dispatched — and therefore already paid for — before re-raising.
`OCRLLMError.partial_results` defaults to `()` for every other error.

### D4 — Image resume does not cover the case that loses money. **Medium. Partly fixed 2026-08-18.**

Fixed: `resume=True` is no longer rejected outright for injected providers.
Reuse is opt-in and caller-declared — the provider must expose a nonempty
`resume_identity` string that changes whenever its recognition behaviour
changes. Without it the previous `ConfigError` still fires, now naming the
attribute. The library cannot infer behavioural equivalence of two injected
objects, so silent reuse is never inferred.

Still open: checkpointing is per whole request. One `recognize()` call can spend
up to six provider calls (drafts, review, three sign scouts) and a crash inside
that call still discards all of them. The batch-level money loss is covered by
D3; the intra-request loss is not.

### D5 — Local OCR is not runnable in the maintained development environment. **Medium. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

`local_ocr/load_rapidocr.py` imports `rapidocr` (the 3.x API), while
`D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM` only provided `rapidocr-onnxruntime 1.4.4`, which
exposes a different module and a different result API.

Fix: `rapidocr` 3.9.2 is installed in `D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM`, matching the
`ocr` extra pin `rapidocr>=3.9,<4` in `pyproject.toml`. The `DependencyMissing`
details now name the required distribution and call out
`rapidocr-onnxruntime` as an incompatible substitute. The code was not taught a
second backend API: one supported engine, matched by the environment.

Verify:

```powershell
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -c "from rapidocr import RapidOCR; import importlib.metadata as m; print(m.version('rapidocr'))"
```

### D6 — The legacy test suite leaks registry keys. **Low. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

`QSettings.clear()` removes values but leaves the organization key, so each run
left an empty `HKCU\Software\OCRLLMTests-<uuid>` tree behind.

Fix: `legacy_app/tests/delete_test_qsettings_tree.py` deletes the tree in
teardown and refuses any organization name outside the `OCRLLMTests-` prefix.
The 60 orphaned keys present on the development machine were deleted by running
that module directly; all 60 held zero values.

### D7 — `RecognitionResult` prose drift. **Low. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

The field is `source_type`. `Architecture.md` described its values as
`"board" | "pdf" | "video" | "audio" | "office"`; board is a `profile`, not a
source type. Corrected there. `docs/ocrllm_module_target_design.md` was already
correct: `SourceDescriptor.media_type`, `Artifact.media_type`, and
`ProcessorOutput.media_type` are real, distinct fields and are not drift.


## Structure Decisions

### Keep and maintain

- `errors.py`, `provider_error_disposition.py`, and the DashScope error mapping.
  Correct, live-verified, and the foundation for every future provider.
- `imaging/snapshot_image_group.py` and the validation chain. Correct and
  race-proof.
- `config.py` immutability and exact-type validation.

### Keep but freeze

`contracts/` and `worker/` stay in the tree. They are tested and they encode a
real decision about process isolation. Do not delete them.

**Freeze confirmed 2026-08-18. They are closed to change.** No new fields, no
new commands or events, no protocol version bump, and no new tests. They have no
consumer, and 1,817 lines is already 23% of the library.

A future slice that needs to change them must first produce the consumer that
justifies the change, in the same slice. Note that
`contracts/image_recognition_request.py` hardcodes
`provider: Literal["dashscope"]` and `profile: Literal["board"]`, so the protocol
cannot represent modality splitting or audio. That revision belongs to whichever
slice delivers a real consumer, and to no slice before it.

When a Phase 1 change makes a frozen contract inaccurate, record the divergence
in this file and move on. Do not chase the contract into sync.

### Reconsider before reuse

The three-scout standalone-sign quorum costs four provider calls per image. In
the v17 evidence it restored exactly one sign across 26 dispatches. Keep the
code; it is careful and correct. Do not treat it as the default workflow for
future providers or media types without re-measuring its yield on that provider.

## Coding Rules

These are additive to the implementation directive in
`docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md`, which remains in force.

1. **One file, one responsibility, named for that responsibility.** This rule
   stays. It has been applied past its purpose in places: an 8-line file for a
   single predicate costs more navigation than it saves. Group trivially small
   pure helpers with their only caller.
2. **Validate at boundaries, once.** Do not re-validate an already-validated
   immutable value on every internal hop.
3. **No success without content.** Empty, control-only, *and refusal-shaped*
   provider output are all failures. See D1.
4. **No unbounded wait.** Every path that can block on an external party must
   have a caller-visible bound. See D2.
5. **Never destroy paid work.** Any operation that has already spent money must
   surface what succeeded, even when a later item fails. See D3.
6. **No hidden cost.** Revised 2026-08-18; see "Policy Change: Disclosed
   Automatic Recovery" below. Automatic retry and model switching are now
   permitted, but only when the caller opted in and every attempt is disclosed.
   Silent extra paid calls remain forbidden.
7. **New structure requires a failing case.** Add an abstraction when a real
   failure demands it, not when one is imagined.

## Policy Change: Disclosed Automatic Recovery

Decided 2026-08-18. This **reverses** part of the earlier rule in
`docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md` that reads:

> Perform no automatic model switch, key rotation, paid-provider fallback, or
> hidden retry in the first adapter.

That rule existed to prevent *undisclosed* paid calls. It was correct about the
harm and too broad about the mechanism. A provider on a free tier returns
`QuotaExhausted` on a per-model basis, and a library that cannot move to the
next free model forces every caller to reimplement the same loop.

The rule is replaced by four conditions. All four must hold.

1. **Opt-in.** Automatic recovery happens only when the caller supplies an
   explicit candidate list. No default candidate chain. An unconfigured call
   behaves exactly as it does today: one attempt, then a typed error.
2. **Disclosed.** Every attempt appears in an ordered attempt ledger in the
   result metadata and in the error details: model tried, disposition, and
   outcome. A caller must be able to reconstruct exactly what was spent.
3. **Disposition-gated.** Switching triggers only on dispositions that mean
   "this model or credential cannot serve the request" — quota exhausted,
   unavailable, permission denied. Never on a generic failure, never on
   `PROVIDER_RESPONSE_INVALID`, and never on a refusal.
4. **Bounded.** A maximum attempt count and a terminating error when the whole
   chain is exhausted. No unbounded loop, no silent give-up.

The behavior oracle is `legacy_app/OCRLLM/core/llm_client.py`, functions
`_vision_fallback_chain`, `_call_with_free_tier_fallback`, and
`_notify_free_tier_switch`. Legacy already orders the caller's primary model
first, slides down the chain on free-tier exhaustion only, notifies the user on
every switch, and raises a distinct "all exhausted" error at the end. Port that
behavior statement, not the file.

## Policy Change: Model Discovery Replaces The Fixed Allowlist

Decided 2026-08-18. The three-model DashScope allowlist in
`resolve_dashscope_model.py` is retired as a gate on caller choice.

The allowlist was protecting a real thing: live quality evidence is measured
against one pinned model snapshot, and silently changing models invalidates it.
That protection is preserved by separating two concepts that were conflated:

- **The evidence baseline** stays pinned and named in result metadata. A quality
  claim always states which model produced it.
- **Caller model choice** is validated against the provider's live catalog, not
  against a hardcoded set. An unknown model fails because the provider does not
  serve it, not because a constant in this repository is out of date.

A model outside the evidence baseline is usable and must be reported as
unproven, not blocked. Do not silently imply baseline quality for a model that
was never gated.

Relevant measurement: the `board.v17` prompt against `qwen3.5-ocr` produced 16
completion tokens and no usable output, while the pinned model produced a full
transcription from the same prompt and image. Prompt and model class are
coupled. Discovery makes a model *selectable*; it does not make it *proven*.

## Documentation Rules

The `docs/` directory holds 54 files and 8,699 lines for a 7,824-line library.
That ratio is the problem this section fixes.

1. **One current-state file.** This file. Update it in place; do not add a
   parallel status document.
2. **Historical records are immutable and clearly dated.** A `phase*` file is
   never edited after its gate closes and never cited as current state.
3. **Do not create a decision file and a checkpoint file per slice.** One entry
   in this file plus one dated record if a paid gate ran.
4. **A capability claim names its verification command.** A claim that cannot be
   re-run is not evidence.
5. **When code and documentation disagree, fix the documentation in the same
   change.** A stale doc is a defect, tracked like any other.
6. **Warn, do not imply.** If something is unverified, say so in the sentence
   that describes it.

```powershell
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -m compileall -q src tests
```

Import-weight check:

```powershell
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -c "import sys,time; t=time.perf_counter(); import ocrllm; print(round(time.perf_counter()-t,4), len(sys.modules), [m for m in ('PIL','openai','httpx','onnxruntime') if m in sys.modules])"
```

Credentials for live work are stored by the legacy GUI under
`HKCU\Software\OCRLLM\QCR\ui`. Read them from the registry; never hardcode a key
and never print one. Do not run a paid gate without an explicit budget from the
maintainer.
