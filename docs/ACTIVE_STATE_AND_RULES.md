# Active State And Rules

Status: **authoritative and current.** Last verified 2026-08-22 against the
working tree, tests, and recorded commit history.

This file outranks every other document in this repository. Read it before
`docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md`, before `START_HERE.md`, and before any
`phase*` file.

## Document Precedence

Contradictions between documents are resolved in this order. A lower-ranked
file never overrides a higher-ranked one.

```text
1. docs/ACTIVE_STATE_AND_RULES.md     This file. Current truth and rules.
2. docs/plan_phase1_maturation_and_phase2_audio.md
                                      Current work plan; implementation status
                                      is recorded here, not inferred from the
                                      plan text.
3. docs/plan_phase1_defects_and_provider_split.md
                                      Stage 1 history and the not-started
                                      vision/audio split plan.
4. docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md    Execution contract, gates, boundaries.
                                      Its dated verification log is history.
5. MIGRATION_STATUS.md / START_HERE.md  Navigation copies of this state.
6. docs/phase*, *_decision_*, *_checkpoint_*
                                      Immutable historical records. Never cite
                                      them as current state.
```

Every dated phase, decision, checkpoint, and incident file is a frozen record
of one past attempt. It keeps the trace but does not define the present. Read
this file first, then verify the named code and tests before trusting any
historical claim.

## Project Posture Changed

The library was built as a feasibility spike: prove that one narrow vertical
slice (DashScope + image) could carry a stable public contract. That question
is answered. The contract, quality-gate, and error layers work.

**The posture is now a maintained product**, not a probe. This changes three
things:

- Defects in shipped surface outrank new capability. A known false-success path
  is not acceptable because "the phase is complete".
- Structure is justified by an observed failure, not by an anticipated one.
  Anything already built that lacks a consumer is frozen, not extended.
- Documentation is a maintained artifact with a single current-state file, not
  an append-only research log.

Phase 1 is consequently reopened for maturation. "Phase 1 is GO" means the image
path was proven once under trial constraints; it does not mean the image path is
finished. Stage M is **offline implementation-complete**: model catalog
discovery, file-backed state sidecars, opt-in disposition-gated candidate
queues, slot-indexed intra-request checkpoints, spend disclosure, and
model-aware credential blocking have shipped. Its exit gate remains open until
the authorized paid live smoke verifies current provider behavior. Stage 2
vision/audio provider splitting and Stage A mp3 recognition have not started.
See `docs/plan_phase1_maturation_and_phase2_audio.md`.

## Known Debt In This Repository

Future agents must assume the following and verify before trusting any claim:

- **Fixture byte-reproduction is environment-bound (redesigned 2026-08-19).** The Phase 1 generated-image corpus can only be byte-reproduced in the exact Pillow wheel build that created it; that environment is lost and no installable 12.x build reproduces the pinned pixels. `tests/quality/generators/generate_phase1_fixtures.py` now checks three layers instead: manifest-hash integrity (every environment), same-environment determinism, and reproduction that is byte-strict only under the recorded `GENERATOR_ENVIRONMENT` and pixel-tolerant otherwise. Do not re-baseline the committed images without a maintainer decision: they are the pixels the v17 live evidence was scored against.

- **Dated documentation is history.** Old phase and review files deliberately
   retain their original conclusions. Current navigation documents must point
   here and must not repeat those conclusions as present status.
- **Structure runs ahead of demand.** `contracts/` and `worker/` are 1,817
  lines (23% of the library) serving a subprocess protocol with no consumer.
  They are correct and tested; they are also not yet load-bearing.
- **Recognition logic is small.** `processors/`, `profiles/`, and `imaging/`
  total 1,059 lines. Most of the library is contract and validation. That ratio
  is acceptable for a library, but it means new capability is cheap and new
  ceremony is expensive. Bias toward capability.

## Verified State, 2026-08-22

Confirmed by execution, not by reading prose. Method noted so it can be redone.

| Property | Result | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Test suite | 1060 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed (163.42 s) | `D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider` |
| Import weight | 1.12 ms wall median, 1.70 ms p95; 0 ms CPU median, 15.63 ms p95 | clean-wheel gate, 30 measured fresh processes after two warm-ups |
| Heavy-module isolation | `PIL`, `pypdfium2`, `openai`, `httpx`, `onnxruntime`, and `legacy_app` absent after plain import | outside-repository clean-wheel `sys.modules` probe |
| Phase 1 evidence integrity | 107,246 bytes, SHA-256 `6f0454d6…a96b`, exact match to the recorded claim | `Get-FileHash` |
| Pinned model exists | `qwen3.7-plus-2026-05-26` served by the account | live `GET /models` |
| Snapshot isolation | Provider reads original bytes while a concurrent thread overwrites the source | threaded race probe |
| Corrupt-input rejection | zero-byte, truncated, and extension/content mismatch all raise `InvalidSource` before dispatch | live probe |
| Secret redaction | `api_key` absent from `repr`, error message, and error details | live probe |
| Live error mapping | 401, 403 `AllocationQuota.FreeTierOnly`, 404, timeout all mapped to correct type and disposition | live paid probe |

These are load-bearing and must not regress. The error taxonomy and the
snapshot isolation are the two strongest parts of this codebase; build on them.

## Defect Register

Severity is impact on a real user, not implementation effort. D1-D7 are closed,
including the residual D4 limitation (closed 2026-08-22 by `cd7429c`). Of the
Stage M findings G1-G10 are closed in offline code and tests. The Stage M exit
gate is still open because its paid live smoke has not run; closing a code
finding does not imply that current provider-account behavior was live-proven.
Do not close an entry without a test that fails before the fix.

All seven entries were addressed on 2026-08-18, following Stage 1 of
`docs/plan_phase1_defects_and_provider_split.md`. Regression coverage for D1-D4
lives in `tests/test_defect_register_regressions.py`. The current full-suite
command is:

```powershell
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

The exact result is refreshed by the verification command before each status
update. No paid live call is implied by an offline pass.

### D1 — Provider refusal text is accepted as success. **High. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

Marker coverage was extended on 2026-08-18 for apology-prefixed refusals.

`providers/validate_provider_markdown.py` only asked whether the response
contained a visible character. A model that replied `无法识别图片内容，请重新上传`
or `I'm sorry, I can't help with identifying content in this image` was returned
to the caller as a successful recognition.

Fix: `providers/looks_like_refusal.py` ports the behaviour statement of the
legacy `core/output_quality.py::looks_like_refusal` remedy and is applied inside
`validate_provider_markdown`, so both the injected and built-in paths are
covered. A refusal raises `ProviderError` with the new stable code
`PROVIDER_REFUSED_RECOGNITION` and `details["reason"] == "refusal"`; empty or
control-only output keeps `PROVIDER_RESPONSE_INVALID` with
`details["reason"] == "empty"`. The new code's disposition is registered as
`("change_source", "request")`: the model declined a well-formed request, so the
source is what must change. Detection is capped at 300 visible characters, so a
long transcription containing a refusal phrase is still accepted.

Offline Phase 1 quality scorer re-run after the change: 70 passed
(`pytest tests/test_run_phase1_quality.py tests/test_quality_gate_application.py
tests/test_score_recognition_result.py tests/test_verify_fixture_artifacts.py`).
No committed corpus expectation changed.

Not addressed by this fix: the Phase 1 v17 GO ran through the old validator, so
that gate could not distinguish a refusal from a transcription. The GO is not
re-established by this change.

### D2 — `Config.timeout_seconds` is not enforced for injected providers. **High. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

`timeout_seconds` was only threaded into the DashScope OpenAI client, so an
injected provider that blocked hung the caller permanently.

Fix: the worker-thread design from S1.2 was chosen over renaming the field,
because `timeout_seconds` is a public field and a caller expects it to bind.
`providers/bounded_provider_call.py` runs each injected-provider call on a
pre-warmed daemon worker thread and joins it with `Config.timeout_seconds`,
raising `ProviderError(code="PROVIDER_TIMEOUT", retryable=True)` when the bound
elapses. The abandoned thread is disclosed in the error as
`details["abandoned_provider_thread"] = True`. The worker is started and parked
*before* the request-start gate is awaited, so thread startup does not disturb
the measured provider cadence, and it never dispatches when the gate raises
instead of releasing. Built-in DashScope calls keep their transport timeout and
are not wrapped.

Known limit: a wedged provider thread cannot be killed. It is abandoned as a
daemon thread rather than allowed to block interpreter shutdown.

### D3 — `recognize_batch` discards completed paid work on any failure. **High. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

**Signature change, taken deliberately.** `recognize_batch` now returns
`list[BatchItemOutcome]` instead of `list[RecognitionResult]`.
`BatchItemOutcome` carries `index` and exactly one of `result` or `error`, so a
caller reads successes and failures from the same ordered list.

Execution semantics are unchanged: bounded worker pool, caller order, fail-fast.
The first failure aborts the start gate and cancels pending futures; calls that
were already dispatched — and therefore already paid for — are drained and
settled, and every source that was never attempted gets a `Cancelled` outcome so
the returned list always matches the caller's source order.

### D4 — Image resume does not cover the case that loses money. **Medium. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

Two changes, both using the existing versioned job-state format. No second
checkpoint format was introduced.

1. `resume=True` is no longer rejected outright for injected providers. Reuse is
   opt-in and caller-declared: the provider must expose a nonempty
   `resume_identity` string that changes whenever its recognition behaviour
   changes. Without it the previous `ConfigError` still fires, now naming the
   attribute. The library cannot infer behavioural equivalence of two injected
   objects, so equivalence is never inferred silently.
2. The job-state file is **retained** after successful publication instead of
   being deleted. That single change is what makes a batch resume at item
   granularity: re-running the same batch reuses each completed item's state,
   spends nothing on it, and re-pays only for the items that failed. The
   now-unreachable `output/delete_image_resume_state.py` was removed.

Consequence to know: `output_dir` accumulates one `<stem>.ocrllm-state.json`
beside each published Markdown file. That file is the proof of paid work; do not
prune it as clutter.

Checkpointing inside one request is closed by Stage M2 (see "Stage M
Implementation Status"): each workflow pass now persists as it completes and
`resume=True` reuses persisted passes at slot granularity.

### D5 — Local OCR is not runnable in the maintained development environment. **Medium. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

`local_ocr/load_rapidocr.py` imports `rapidocr` (the 3.x API), while
`D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM` only provided `rapidocr-onnxruntime 1.4.4`, which
exposes a different module and a different result API.

Fix: `rapidocr` 3.9.2 is installed in `D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM`, matching the
`ocr` extra pin `rapidocr>=3.9,<4` in `pyproject.toml`. The `DependencyMissing`
details now name the required distribution and call out
`rapidocr-onnxruntime` as an incompatible substitute. The code was not taught a
second backend API: one supported engine, matched by the environment.

Verify:

```powershell
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -c "from rapidocr import RapidOCR; import importlib.metadata as m; print(m.version('rapidocr'))"
```

### D6 — The legacy test suite leaks registry keys. **Low. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

`QSettings.clear()` removes values but leaves the organization key, so each run
left an empty `HKCU\Software\OCRLLMTests-<uuid>` tree behind.

Fix: `legacy_app/tests/delete_test_qsettings_tree.py` deletes the tree in
teardown and refuses any organization name outside the `OCRLLMTests-` prefix.
The 60 orphaned keys present on the development machine were deleted by running
that module directly; all 60 held zero values.

### D7 — `RecognitionResult` prose drift. **Low. Fixed 2026-08-18.**

The field is `source_type`. `Architecture.md` described its values as
`"board" | "pdf" | "video" | "audio" | "office"`; board is a `profile`, not a
source type. Corrected there. `docs/ocrllm_module_target_design.md` was already
correct: `SourceDescriptor.media_type`, `Artifact.media_type`, and
`ProcessorOutput.media_type` are real, distinct fields and are not drift.


## Structure Decisions

### Keep and maintain

- `errors.py`, `provider_error_disposition.py`, and the DashScope error mapping.
  Correct, live-verified, and the foundation for every future provider.
- `imaging/snapshot_image_group.py` and the validation chain. Correct and
  race-proof.
- `config.py` immutability and exact-type validation.

### Keep but freeze

`contracts/` and `worker/` stay in the tree. They are tested and they encode a
real decision about process isolation. Do not delete them.

**Freeze confirmed 2026-08-18. They are closed to change.** No new fields, no
new commands or events, no protocol version bump, and no new tests. They have no
consumer, and 1,817 lines is already 23% of the library.

A future slice that needs to change them must first produce the consumer that
justifies the change, in the same slice. Note that
`contracts/image_recognition_request.py` hardcodes
`provider: Literal["dashscope"]` and `profile: Literal["board"]`, so the protocol
cannot represent modality splitting or audio. That revision belongs to whichever
slice delivers a real consumer, and to no slice before it.

When a Phase 1 change makes a frozen contract inaccurate, record the divergence
in this file and move on. Do not chase the contract into sync.

### Reconsider before reuse

The three-scout standalone-sign quorum costs four provider calls per image. In
the v17 evidence it restored exactly one sign across 26 dispatches. Keep the
code; it is careful and correct. Do not treat it as the default workflow for
future providers or media types without re-measuring its yield on that provider.

## Coding Rules

These are additive to the implementation directive in
`docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md`, which remains in force.

1. **One file, one responsibility, named for that responsibility.** This rule
   stays. It has been applied past its purpose in places: an 8-line file for a
   single predicate costs more navigation than it saves. Group trivially small
   pure helpers with their only caller.
2. **Validate at boundaries, once.** Do not re-validate an already-validated
   immutable value on every internal hop.
3. **No success without content.** Empty, control-only, *and refusal-shaped*
   provider output are all failures. See D1.
4. **No unbounded wait.** Every path that can block on an external party must
   have a caller-visible bound. See D2.
5. **Never destroy paid work.** Any operation that has already spent money must
   surface what succeeded, even when a later item fails. See D3.
6. **No hidden cost.** Revised 2026-08-18; see "Policy Change: Disclosed
   Automatic Recovery" below. Automatic retry and model switching are now
   permitted, but only when the caller opted in and every attempt is disclosed.
   Silent extra paid calls remain forbidden.
7. **New structure requires a failing case.** Add an abstraction when a real
   failure demands it, not when one is imagined.

## Policy Change: Disclosed Automatic Recovery

Decided 2026-08-18. This **reverses** part of the earlier rule in
`docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md` that reads:

> Perform no automatic model switch, key rotation, paid-provider fallback, or
> hidden retry in the first adapter.

That rule existed to prevent *undisclosed* paid calls. It was correct about the
harm and too broad about the mechanism. A provider on a free tier returns
`QuotaExhausted` on a per-model basis, and a library that cannot move to the
next free model forces every caller to reimplement the same loop.

The rule is replaced by four conditions. All four must hold.

1. **Opt-in.** Automatic recovery happens only when the caller supplies an
   explicit candidate list. No default candidate chain. An unconfigured call
   behaves exactly as it does today: one attempt, then a typed error.
2. **Disclosed.** Every attempt appears in an ordered attempt ledger in the
   result metadata and in the error details: model tried, disposition, and
   outcome. A caller must be able to reconstruct exactly what was spent.
3. **Disposition-gated.** Switching triggers only on dispositions that mean
   "this model or credential cannot serve the request" — quota exhausted,
   unavailable, permission denied. Never on a generic failure, never on
   `PROVIDER_RESPONSE_INVALID`, and never on a refusal.
4. **Bounded.** A maximum attempt count and a terminating error when the whole
   chain is exhausted. No unbounded loop, no silent give-up.

The behavior oracle is `legacy_app/OCRLLM/core/llm_client.py`, functions
`_vision_fallback_chain`, `_call_with_free_tier_fallback`, and
`_notify_free_tier_switch`. Legacy already orders the caller's primary model
first, slides down the chain on free-tier exhaustion only, notifies the user on
every switch, and raises a distinct "all exhausted" error at the end. Port that
behavior statement, not the file.

## Policy Change: Model Discovery Replaces The Fixed Allowlist

Decided 2026-08-18. The three-model DashScope allowlist in
`resolve_dashscope_model.py` is retired as a gate on caller choice.

The allowlist was protecting a real thing: live quality evidence is measured
against one pinned model snapshot, and silently changing models invalidates it.
That protection is preserved by separating two concepts that were conflated:

- **The evidence baseline** stays pinned and named in result metadata. A quality
  claim always states which model produced it.
- **Caller model choice** is validated against the provider's live catalog, not
  against a hardcoded set. An unknown model fails because the provider does not
  serve it, not because a constant in this repository is out of date.

A model outside the evidence baseline is usable and must be reported as
unproven, not blocked. Do not silently imply baseline quality for a model that
was never gated.

Implementation status: shipped. Since 2026-08-22 the static set is deleted;
catalog validation applies to every non-pinned model, and only the pinned v17
baseline bypasses the catalog because its proof is the live gate itself. The
policy text above now matches the code.

Relevant measurement: the `board.v17` prompt against `qwen3.5-ocr` produced 16
completion tokens and no usable output, while the pinned model produced a full
transcription from the same prompt and image. Prompt and model class are
coupled. Discovery makes a model *selectable*; it does not make it *proven*.

## Stage M Implementation Status, refreshed 2026-08-22

Stage M is **offline implementation-complete**. The following behavior is
shipped and tested offline:

- Non-baseline DashScope model names can be checked against a lazy provider
   catalog. Successful catalogs have a 600-second TTL; expired catalogs remain
   usable during refresh failure; a first catalog failure is surfaced as the
   retryable `PROVIDER_CATALOG_UNAVAILABLE` error. The catalog path is lazy.
- File-backed image recognition writes versioned state atomically before
   publishing Markdown. Re-running a compatible batch can reuse completed
   request outputs. Within one request, each completed workflow pass persists
   as a slot in the same sidecar before the next paid call starts, and
   `resume=True` pays only for missing passes. Injected-provider resume still
   requires a caller-declared nonempty `resume_identity`.
- An explicit `VisionModelSettings.candidate_models` queue is attempted in
   caller order and advances only for quota exhaustion, provider unavailability,
   and model-scoped permission denial. Credential-scoped permission denial
   stops. The queue is bounded and opt-in; a single-model call retains its
   original typed failure. Every attempt discloses outcome and paid-call count,
   and chain exhaustion raises the distinct `ALL_CANDIDATES_EXHAUSTED` code.
- DashScope free-tier and unpurchased-commodity quota codes are mapped to model
   scope, so the credential pool blocks that model rather than the account;
   account suspension remains account-wide. This distinction is offline-tested
   but has not been re-proven against the live account in this update.
- Scout failures name the scout model and never advance the primary candidate
   queue. Injected typed errors retain only an allowlisted canonical
   `failure_scope`; arbitrary provider details remain discarded.

Every non-paid Stage M exit criterion now passes. Commit `2e9c770` passed the
reusable clean-archive runner in `tools/run_stage_m_offline_gate.ps1`: its
archived suite reported 1059 passed and one expected optional-RapidOCR skip,
fixture verification and compilation passed, the wheel was 150,795 bytes, and
the no-deps target was 736,133 bytes. Fresh `image` and `image,dashscope`
profiles added 16,424,795 and 40,997,504 bytes respectively and passed their
offline smokes. Plain import stayed below every documented wall and process-CPU
budget in both Python environments. The built-in adapter now proves dispatch of
a catalog-served model unknown to this repository, and an operating-system
process-termination test proves a completed paid slot survives and resume pays
only for the missing slots. `worker/` and `contracts/` are unchanged and frozen.

The Stage M exit gate has **not** passed because its paid live catalog and
end-to-end smoke still requires an explicit maintainer budget. No paid provider
request occurred in the offline gate. Do not convert this no-cost proof into a
claim about current provider-account or model-quota semantics.

### Stage M Findings

These are current implementation findings, not historical phase failures.
Their identifiers are stable so plans, tests, and future diary entries can
refer to the same issue.

#### G1 — Attempt ledger cannot reconstruct spend. **High. Closed 2026-08-22.**

`cd7429c` added `provider_calls_attempted` to every successful or typed-failure
`model_attempts` entry and a `workflow_slots` disclosure in result metadata.
Pre-dispatch configuration failures now add a `fix_request` ledger entry with
zero provider calls and `model: null`: no provider model was tried, and
caller-controlled invalid text cannot leak through public error details. If a
fixed scout model fails catalog resolution after a paid primary pass, the same
entry retains that prior call count and names the setup workflow pass.

#### G2 — Recovery is quota-only. **Medium. Closed 2026-08-22.**

The opt-in candidate loop advances for quota exhaustion, provider
unavailability, and model-scoped permission denial. It stops for authentication
failure, credential-scoped permission denial, response-invalid, refusal, and
all other unapproved failures. Exhaustion wrapping occurs only when the caller
actually configured a candidate list; single-model failures retain their
original public identity.

#### G3 — Account blocks prevent eligible model candidates. **Medium. Closed offline 2026-08-22; live semantics pending exit gate.**

Known DashScope free-tier and unpurchased-commodity quota codes now carry model
scope and create only a model block in the credential pool; account suspension
continues to block every model. Tests prove sibling-model acquisition remains
available after model quota. No paid call ran in this update, so whether the
provider still applies those product states per model must be rechecked by the
Stage M live smoke rather than presented as live-proven fact.

#### G4 — Chain exhaustion has the wrong public identity. **Medium. Closed 2026-08-22.**

`AllCandidatesExhausted` no longer subclasses `QuotaExhausted`. It is a direct
`ProviderError` with the new stable code `ALL_CANDIDATES_EXHAUSTED`
(non-retryable, disposition `("stop", "account")`), so callers can distinguish
"the entire configured chain ended" from "one model exhausted." The class moved
from the deleted `all_candidates_exhausted.py` shim into `errors.py`.

#### G5 — Proven-model metadata is too broad. **Medium. Closed 2026-08-22.**

The retired static set lost both remaining roles. `model_evidence` metadata is
now `"proven"` only for the pinned v17 baseline `DEFAULT_DASHSCOPE_MODEL`;
every other model is selectable but `"unproven"`. Catalog validation in
`resolve_dashscope_model` now applies to every non-pinned model (formerly the
static set bypassed it); the pinned baseline keeps its bypass because its proof
is the v17 live gate, not a catalog row. `SUPPORTED_DASHSCOPE_MODELS` is
deleted, and `resolve_dashscope_maximum_images` collapsed to the uniform cap
constant it always returned.

#### G6 — Resume identity version is stale for candidate queues. **Medium. Closed 2026-08-22.**

Closed by `cd7429c` (the Stage M2 slot-resume slice, reviewed and cherry-picked
from the unmerged `stage-m2` branch). The identity version is now explicit:
`ocrllm.image-request.v2`, stored in every new state file. A v1 state is
rejected with `RESUME_STATE_MISMATCH` naming both versions; the v2 document
also hashes the board and sign-scout prompt versions. Nothing migrates; a v1
state is treated as foreign work. See the M2 section below.

#### G7 — Flowed output is not implemented. **Medium. Closed 2026-08-22.**

Closed by `cd7429c` at request granularity: each completed workflow pass
(draft, review, each sign scout) persists immediately as a slot in the
versioned sidecar before the next paid call starts, and `resume=True` seeds
from persisted slots and pays only for missing passes. Batch granularity was
already covered by D3/D4 (one output file plus one retained state sidecar per
item). Proven at the state-machine boundary by `tests/test_m2_slot_resume.py`
and at the operating-system boundary by
`tests/test_m2_process_kill_resume.py`, which terminates a child process after
its second pass starts and then resumes from the first persisted slot.

#### G8 — Scout failures are attributed to the primary model. **Medium. Closed 2026-08-22.**

Every workflow-pass failure now carries its resolved `failed_model`. The outer
candidate ledger distinguishes a scout failure from a primary-model failure,
records the scout identity, and raises without advancing the primary candidate
queue. A built-in DashScope regression proves one primary call plus one failed
scout call and no candidate switch.

#### G10 — Candidate validation is weaker than primary validation. **Low. Closed 2026-08-22.**

`VisionModelSettings` now validates `name` and every `candidate_models` entry
through one shared exact-text predicate (nonempty, already-trimmed, no control
characters), so the recovery chain can no longer accept a name the primary
field would reject.

#### G9 — Catalog outage fail-open. **Closed 2026-08-19.**

Commit `4c5293d` made first-fetch catalog failure retryable and fail closed,
while retaining the last successful catalog during refresh outages.

## Legacy Status, 2026-08-19

The legacy diary contains no currently open product bug. The recorded path,
refusal, atomic-write, partial-failure, PDF-render, resume-root, and checkpoint
cancellation defects are fixed and retained as trace in `legacy_app/AGENTS.md`.
The latest checkpoint-cancellation fix preserves generated outputs when a task
is dismissed; it does not delete paid Markdown implicitly. Any legacy issue
found or fixed in a later session still belongs in that diary before the
session closes.

## New And Fixed In This Working Update

These changes are current, verified, and should not be mistaken for open
defects:

- DashScope explicit settings, pooled credentials, environment credentials,
   catalog authentication, and request dispatch now share one exact-text and
   Coding-Plan rejection policy. Source precedence and pool leasing remain
   separate responsibilities.
- Environment credentials containing surrounding whitespace, embedded control
   characters, or DEL now fail as redacted `CONFIG_INVALID`; only an absent or
   empty credential is `CONFIG_MISSING`. Before this correction, newline and
   DEL values reached the SDK path, while padded values were misclassified.
- The duplicated `recognize_images.py` basename was audited and deliberately
   retained: imports are fully qualified, one module owns board orchestration,
   and the other implements the provider protocol. No collision or duplicated
   behavior exists, so a rename would add churn without simplifying ownership.
- The local active suite passed 1,060 tests. The clean base-profile archive at
   `2e9c770` passed 1,059 with the optional real-RapidOCR test skipped because
   the base profile intentionally has no OCR extra. These counts are
   verification snapshots, not permanent gates for future changes.

### M2. Flowed output and true resume, 2026-08-19

A single `recognize()` call spends up to six provider calls (drafts, review,
three sign scouts). Each completed pass now persists immediately as a
slot-indexed record in the existing `<stem>.ocrllm-state.json` sidecar, and a
crash mid-request discards nothing that was already paid for.

- `image_slot_checkpoint.py` persists one `ImageSlotState` per workflow pass
  (slot id, workflow pass, provider, actual model, validated Markdown with its
  SHA-256, calls attempted) through the existing atomic state writer. No new
  storage backend: the state document gained a `slots` array and is otherwise
  the same versioned sidecar. Slot writes are atomic replaces, so the file is
  valid after every paid call.
- Resume is slot-granular. `resume=True` with a matching fingerprint seeds the
  checkpoint from the persisted slots and pays only for the missing passes; a
  slot is reused only by the same provider **and** model that produced it, so
  a quota fallback to another model never inherits the failed model's passes.
  Preservation is not opt-in: injected providers keep the D4 `resume_identity`
  declaration, and any checkpoint-eligible run persists slots even without
  `resume=True`.
- **Fingerprint identity break, v1 to v2 (audit finding G6).** Commit
  `a19776d` silently changed the v1 fingerprint by adding `candidate_models`
  to the hashed document. The identity version is now explicit:
  `ocrllm.image-request.v2`, stored in every new state file. A state written
  under v1 is rejected with `RESUME_STATE_MISMATCH` whose details name both
  versions (`state_identity_version` / `request_identity_version`). Upgrade
  behavior: nothing migrates; a v1 state is treated as foreign work and the
  request re-runs only after the caller removes it or runs without
  `resume=True`. The v2 document also hashes the board and sign-scout prompt
  versions, closing a silent-stale-resume hole that v1 left open.
- **Paid-call disclosure (audit finding G1).** `RecognitionResult.metadata`
  now carries `workflow_slots`: per slot the workflow pass, provider, actual
  model, whether the slot was reused from disk, and calls attempted. Every
  `model_attempts` ledger entry — success or typed failure — carries
  `provider_calls_attempted`, so a successful fallback no longer discards what
  the failed candidates spent. Typed failures keep their `workflow_pass` and
  `provider_calls_attempted` details.

Regression coverage is `tests/test_m2_slot_resume.py`: an injected mid-request
failure proves slot reuse including sign-scout passes, a hand-written v1 state
proves the version-named rejection, a candidate-fallback run proves
failed-model slots are neither reused nor lost, and a prompt-version bump
proves resume identity invalidates. `tests/test_m2_process_kill_resume.py`
adds the stronger operating-system termination proof. The current offline gate
results are recorded in the Stage M status above. No paid live call was made.
`worker/` and `contracts/` are unchanged.

## Documentation Rules

The `docs/` directory contains both current policy and immutable historical
records. This section prevents the historical volume from becoming a second
source of current truth.

1. **One current-state file.** This file. Update it in place; do not add a
   parallel status document.
2. **Historical records are immutable and clearly dated.** A `phase*` file is
   never edited after its gate closes and never cited as current state.
3. **Do not create a decision file and a checkpoint file per slice.** One entry
   in this file plus one dated record if a paid gate ran.
4. **A capability claim names its verification command.** A claim that cannot be
   re-run is not evidence.
5. **When code and documentation disagree, fix the documentation in the same
   change.** A stale doc is a defect, tracked like any other.
6. **Warn, do not imply.** If something is unverified, say so in the sentence
   that describes it.

## Verification Commands

```powershell
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -m compileall -q src tests
```

Import-weight check:

```powershell
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -c "import sys,time; t=time.perf_counter(); import ocrllm; print(round(time.perf_counter()-t,4), len(sys.modules), [m for m in ('PIL','openai','httpx','onnxruntime') if m in sys.modules])"
```

Credentials for live work are stored by the legacy GUI under
`HKCU\Software\OCRLLM\QCR\ui`. Read them from the registry; never hardcode a key
and never print one. Do not run a paid gate without an explicit budget from the
maintainer.
