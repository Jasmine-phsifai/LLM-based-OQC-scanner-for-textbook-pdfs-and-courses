# START HERE: OCRLLM Repo Map

This repo currently contains two codebases. Treat the directory boundary as a
hard signal before editing or importing anything.

**Read `docs/ACTIVE_STATE_AND_RULES.md` first.** It outranks every other file,
including this one, and it carries current state, the open defect register, and
the coding and documentation rules.

**Documentation in this repo lags the code.** Historical `docs/phase*` files
record conclusions that were true only on their own date. Verify capability
claims against code and tests before relying on them.

## Active New Library

Path: `src/ocrllm/`

Use for:

- New importable package: `ocrllm`
- Stable public API work
- New downstream project dependencies
- Root test suite under `tests/`

Read in this order:

```text
docs/ACTIVE_STATE_AND_RULES.md        Current truth, defects, rules. Outranks all.
docs/plan_phase1_defects_and_provider_split.md
                                      The approved next slice.
docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md       Phase gates, file responsibilities,
                                      migrate/rewrite/reject boundary.
src/ocrllm/README_ACTIVE_LIBRARY.md   Package boundary and capability surface.
src/ocrllm/AGENTS.md                  Package editing rules.
MIGRATION_STATUS.md                   Navigation aid.
docs/ocrllm_module_target_design.md   Target-state module map.
docs/provider_cost_and_reliability_policy.md
                                      Account-specific provider policy.
```

Everything else under `docs/` is a dated historical record. Consult one only to
understand how a past decision was reached, never to learn current state.

Public import shape:

```python
from ocrllm import Config, DashScopeSettings, VisionModelSettings, recognize
```

Completed phase: **Phase 2A -- image library completion**. Phase 0 contract
honesty, Phase 1 real board/image, Phase 2 JSONL worker, and Phase 2A are GO.
Local OCR, shared execution policy, adapter-owned DashScope/model configuration,
provider error disposition, region-bound credential scheduling, and image
resume are verified. No later phase is active; Phase 3 PDFium remains not
started. The Phase 2
formal GO commit is `2db456a` and its clean Git-archive proof passes.
The active facade now decodes valid PNG/JPEG inputs before provider dispatch,
passes request-scoped validated snapshots isolated from later caller-path
changes to one synchronous injected provider,
rejects empty or control-only provider output, returns typed/redacted public
errors, and reports
canonical `source_type="image"` with `profile="board"`. File output remains
optional and atomic; `output_dir=None` stays memory-only. Pillow is installed by
the `image` extra and remains lazy during plain `import ocrllm`.

Phase 1 uses one unified `board.v17` workflow for printed, projected,
handwritten, formula, table, and ordered-image inputs. The Beijing live gate
completed all 13 recognitions and exactly 52 provider calls with no retry or
terminal failure. Both independent six-dispatch runs passed. Run A required no
restoration; Run B restored exactly one missing handwriting sign through the
same generic two-of-three omission-scout path used for every image class.

Preserve
`evidence/phase1/phase1-quality-v17-2026-07-11-cn-beijing.json`: 107,246
bytes, SHA-256
`6f0454d634dbe76f68f29c07a4c0ced4a047c080e46bb75dda2cb84ffca3a96b`.
The clean Git-archive gate at `0278b66` passed 712 tests, fixture-byte identity,
compilation, a 67,266-byte wheel, base import and timing budgets, a generated
image recognition, and fresh `image` plus Beijing `image,dashscope` profiles.
The image/provider and v1alpha1 worker capabilities are available. The active
post-Phase-2 decision now authorizes only the Phase 2A provider-workflow slice.

The active library has a DashScope in-memory credential scheduler and image
resume, but no automatic retry, model fallback, or persistent/cross-process pool
state. That absence is deliberate: adapters must not create undisclosed paid
calls. PDF, audio, and video support remain absent. Local user PDFs/screenshots
under `docs/` remain untracked supplemental test material, not redistributable
gate evidence.

Phase 1 GO carries one open qualification: the quality gate's false-success
guard cannot detect provider refusal text. See defect D1 in
`docs/ACTIVE_STATE_AND_RULES.md`.

## Legacy Application

Path: `legacy_app/`

Use for:

- Read-only behavior reference for old GUI, CLI, FastAPI, processors, and
  launchers
- Historical outputs and incident records used to define active-library
  fixtures

Read next:

- `legacy_app/README_LEGACY.md`
- `legacy_app/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/legacy_bilibili_social_long_debug_record.md` for multi-part Bilibili
  course download/recognition recovery.
- `docs/legacy_youtube_playlist_social_long_workflow.md` for YouTube playlist
  course download/recognition recovery.
- `docs/legacy_filetrans_codex_debug_record.md` for Codex/FileTrans recovery.

Do not use as a new dependency boundary:

```python
import legacy_app.OCRLLM
```

## Suspended Future Plan

Path: `Architecture.md`

Status: future plan, currently suspended.

Do not make the Rust/PyO3 rewrite active again until the Python import contract
has real downstream usage and stable module boundaries.

## Runtime Artifacts

These paths are not source-of-truth code:

- `output/`
- `temp/`
- `ocrllm_social_e2e/`
- `.pytest_cache/`
- `__pycache__/`

Do not infer architecture from generated output or temporary files.

```

## Do Not Cross These Boundaries

- Do not import `legacy_app.OCRLLM` from new downstream projects.
- Do not copy a whole legacy module into `src/ocrllm`.
- Do not let `import ocrllm` pull GUI, FastAPI, social downloader, or heavy
  media dependencies.
- Do not treat `Architecture.md` as the active implementation plan.
- Do not put runtime output defaults inside package directories.
- Do not add PyMuPDF or `fitz` to the active library. Active PDF work uses
  PDFium through `pypdfium2` only after the PDF phase is authorized.
- Do not begin or claim HarmonyOS/ArkTS compatibility. It is deferred by the
  active GO/NO-GO decision.

## Verification Commands

The pinned offline checkpoint checks are:

```powershell
uv run --no-project --isolated --with 'Pillow==12.3.0' `
  --with 'pytest>=8,<10' --with 'openai>=2.30,<3' `
  --python 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' `
  python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
uv run --no-project --isolated --with 'Pillow==12.3.0' `
  --python 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' `
  python -m tests.quality.generators.generate_phase1_fixtures --check
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -m compileall -q src tests
```

Before reporting completion, run the clean Git-archive wheel build, isolated
install, and outside-repo heavy-module guard in
`docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md`. Do not run the paid live gate until the
exact region/`base_url` is confirmed by the caller and the runner's Git/import,
manifest, artifact, and credential preflight passes.

Active-library migration tests must not modify or run the legacy suite as a
phase gate. Create fixtures and tests under root `tests/`. Legacy commands and
tests are historical reference unless a separate legacy-maintenance request
explicitly authorizes that work.
